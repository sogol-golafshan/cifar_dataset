# Cifar-10 Dataset

 The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 
 
 In this project, I used the cifar dataset and built a neural network model. The code in a modular way and include pre-processing, model development, and model testing/validation.
